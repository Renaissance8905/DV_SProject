# War & Peace: A Visualization
#### Final Project for CS327: Elements of Data Visualization

This project marries a number of data mining and visualization technologies to expose fascinating patterns in global refugee movements and religious trends in relation to outbreaks of war, invasions, revolutions and other periods of aggression.

Chris Spradling leverages a massive dataset of world religions, subdivided by denomination, as a percentage of each country's year-over-year population. Designed in a series of Tableau workbooks and recreated in shinyapps.io, his yearly slideshow of target countries' religious demographic provide a glimpse at an astoundingly pronounced trend in the denominational organization of two of the world's largest religions.

Quan Nguyen researches the rise of Atheism and nonreligious affiliation throughout the years, attempting to discover whether it has a stronger correlation to wars, population shifts, or is simply an independent product of time. He takes a special look at Vietnam, whose bifurcation between Buddhist and Nonreligious populations provide for some terribly interesting trend anomalies when compared to world averages.

James Thorpe examines a table of every recorded conflict in recent global history, demarcated to a fine grain by type of conflict, level of aggression, and participating countries. In Tableau, he zeroes in on China's conflicts layered over its reported refugee emigrations and immigrations. Trends emerge, implied causation is avoided, and heads are scratched at China's unique sociopolitical landscape.
