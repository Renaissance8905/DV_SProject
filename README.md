# Refugee Flow
#### An R/Tableau Project for CS327: Elements of Data Visualization
## By Chris Spradling, James Thorpe, and Quan Nguyen, 2015

In This project, our team uses advanced blending and visualization techniques on top several fine-tuned SQL queries to analyze trends in emigration and immigration throughout the world for the last half century.

Chris Spradling seeks to answer some questions: is there any predictable relationship between the permanent population of a country and the number of refugees it is willing to host? If so, do those trends vary region? By decade? To investigate, Chris wrangles refugee statistics alongside world population figures to generate layered visualizations of refugee influx numbers over time, normalized both against each country's population. He then goes on to blend his findings together and inspect from the 10,000-foot perspective, examining the same figures coalesced and normalized by continent. The findings are compelling, somewhat disheartening, and may offer a useful historical insight into Europe's likely response to its current influx of immigrants.

Quan Nguyen examines the changing relationship between Vietnam and China in the final days of the cold war, through the sizes and trajectories of populations out of nearby Southeast Asian countries. Through multi-dimensional charting, he paints a picture of a veritable dam burst as populations reorganize themselves following the fall of the Iron Curtain.

James Thorpe zeroes in on a US/Germany case study, in an attempt to discover what-- if any-- influence a refugee's host and destination country have on whether he or she will seek temporary asylum or permanent residence. His cross tabs condense boil mountains of immigration data into broad asylum-preference categories, and his visualization bring to light surprisingly complex international relational tensions buried in the patterns of refugee-seekers.
